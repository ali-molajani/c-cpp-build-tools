# why C/CPP
I'm not that active in c/cpp as paid dev not in electronics world nor software development so my main focus is mainly on programming languages that i enjoy and now that is `Rust` and `Zig` and i'm gonna choose between those. But most of the algorithm docs and my previous codes are in those format so i should update my tools beside i want to use make for other projects or languages.

The make stuff is gonna be more in C rather than CPP cause i hate cpp for different reasons.
# Steps
1. I'm going to start from a simple bash script to compile and run 
2. start using cmake
3. based on the project size you can choose between the bash script or cmake and the that is the final goal.
